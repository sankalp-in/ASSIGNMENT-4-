# 📄 Assignment 4 – Python File Handling

This assignment demonstrates basic file handling operations using Python — including reading, writing, and appending data in text files.

---

## 📂 Files Used

- `task_1assinment4.py` – Reads the first two lines from a specified text file.
- `task_2assignment4.py` – Writes and appends user input to a file.
- `sample.txt` – Sample file to test reading.
- `output.txt` – Output file generated by Task 2.

---

## 🧠 What Each Script Does

### ✅ `task_1assinment4.py` – Read File Content

This script performs the following:
- Prompts the user for a `.txt` filename.
- Reads the **first two lines** of that file.
- Displays the content on screen.
- Handles file-not-found errors gracefully.

🔹 **Sample Input:**
```
Enter Name of a file(in .txt format): sample.txt
```

🔹 **Sample Output:**
```
Reading file content :
Line1: This is a simple text file.
Line2: It contains multiple lines.
```

### ✅ `task_2assignment4.py` – Write & Append to File

This script does the following:
1. Prompts the user to **write** text to `output.txt`.
2. Then prompts for **additional text to append**.
3. Displays the **final contents** of `output.txt`.

🔹 **Sample Interaction:**
```
Enter text to write to the file: hello
Enter additional text to append: there

Final content of output.txt:
hello
there
```

## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure all files are in the same folder. Then, run each script using:

```bash
python task_1assinment4.py
python task_2assignment4.py
```

Use `sample.txt` for testing Task 1.
